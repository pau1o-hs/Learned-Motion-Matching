# Learned Motion Matching (Work in progress)

![LMM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55563608/139554887-036a45a1-d88e-4fdb-a9d7-d6592f2738c9.gif)

A neural-network-based generative model for character animation.

The system takes user controls as input to automatically produce high quality motions that achieves the desired target. Implemented using Pytorch.

Following Ubisoft La-Forge [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386569.3392440).

## How it works
Currently, this project can be separated in two parts: 
* Unity: Extract all character animations information and store in three files: XData.txt, YData.txt and HierarchyData.txt;
* Pytorch: Using above generated datas, neural network models are trained.

After training, .onnx files are generated and exported to Unity, where the neural nets inference can be run using [Barracuda](https://medium.com/@a.abelhopereira/how-to-use-pytorch-models-in-unity-aa1e964d3374).

### XData.txt
This file consist of C blocks, F lines and M columns. C is the number of clips; Fi is the number of frames of clip i; M is the number of features (Described [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386569.3392440?casa_token=vfgWm5NZnE0AAAAA:LpyNyvcno0zSmbZETgY_q2jM3oeBGvC2QLTc-1383m4V2pnxkxR39P3XUllljGk4-91rB84Nn9fA), section 3:  BASIC MOTION MATCHING).
Each block C is separated by a empty line. 

Let's consider the following animation database: 
```
C = 2, F[0] = 3, F[1] = 4, M = 24
```

XData.txt should be in this format (illustrative values):

```

### YData.txt
Similar to XData, but M is the number of pose information

### HierarchyData.txt
This file stores the character hierarchy to generate Forward Kinematcs for Pytorch usage. Consists of N lines, the number of joints of our character. Each line refers to it parent joint, except the root, which is 0.

Let's consider the following rig hierarchy:
```
       root
         |
      spine_01
        / \ 
  leg_l    leg_r
```

HierarchyData.txt should be:
```
0
0
1
1

```

## Roadmap
You can download the Unity project and check the updates right [here](https://github.com/pau1o-hs/Learned-Motion-Matching/releases)

## Note
I've already managed to make the system work, it's just not perfect yet. Warning that I'm still just an undergraduate, I'm not sure about anything hahahaha.
